The main thing\n                  prompting it was frustration with how difficult it seemed to\n                  be for people to efficiently explain and debate their views,\n                  once the conversation had expanded beyond a few basic points.\n                  I spent a lot of time reading online then, and had read dozens\n                  of threads where people seemed to endlessly debate things\n                  while making hardly any progress. Even when good points and\n                  rebuttals were brought up, there were 20 other things in the\n                  air at each point, making the pieces of good reasoning lose\n                  their impact.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Because of how important some of these topics were, it\n                  concerned me to see the difficulty people had at negotiating\n                  understanding. I decided I would try my best to help create a\n                  solution to the problem, using software to collect and\n                  organize the information that was then spread out among the\n                  forum threads, wiki pages, and individuals, into a\n                  community-edited tree-based structure that's easier to\n                  traverse and explore. My first iteration of this software,\n                  Debate Map, can be found below.\n                </p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  <a href=\"https://debatemap.live/\">Debate Map</a>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <a href=\"https://github.com/Venryx\">Github profile</a>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n\n              <h3>Oz Fraier</h3>\n              <p>\n                <img\n                  width=\"400\"\n                  src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3d6d7d0f8c1cb813877ba08c0a157a28ce5585be/68747470733a2f2f64726976652e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f75633f6578706f72743d766965772669643d3149594142577378314e35366f4f376c59796b75714a6b726a6e6b614976707337\"\n                  alt=\"oz\"\n                />\n              </p>\n              <blockquote>\n                <p>\n                  Living in Israel, a country that is characterized by many\n                  ongoing political and social problems that are difficult to\n                  solve, also known as&nbsp;\n                  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem\">\n                    Wicked Problems\n                  </a>\n                  .
